I am happy to announce the release of Bottle Cap!

- Track tokens that the GM can award to their players.
- Players can spend these tokens to redeem some reward / benefit based on game-system / house rules.
- Spent bottle caps don't disappear but are viewable in a separate tab, so you can look back on all of your most desperate moments.
